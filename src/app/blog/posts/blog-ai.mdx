## Why I Built This

Lately, I’ve been really interested in how AI agents can go beyond just chatting—they can actually **do things**. I wanted to build something that felt like a mini-assistant: it could **read pages**, **extract information**, and **act on it**.

I had a few tools in mind:
- **OpenAI API’s function calling with JSON mode** (feels like magic)
- **EasyOCR** to read messy text from images or scanned pages
- **Playwright** to automate browsing and grab clean data

Putting all three together made me realize how close we are to real-world AI agents. Here’s how I did it.

---

## Step 1 – Telling the AI What It Can Do

OpenAI recently added something called **function calling** in JSON mode. It lets you tell the model *exactly* what kind of data you expect back—and it sticks to it. That’s huge. No more guessing what part of a paragraph you need to parse.

Here’s a sample of how I defined one function:

```ts
const functions = [
  {
    name: "store_entities",
    description: "Save data pulled from a web page",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        url: { type: "string" },
        entities: {
          type: "array",
          items: {
            type: "object",
            properties: {
              name:  { type: "string" },
              value: { type: "string" }
            },
            required: ["name", "value"]
          }
        }
      },
      required: ["url", "entities"]
    }
  }
];
```

## Step 2 – Using OCR to Read Messy Pages

Sometimes data is inside **scanned PDFs or screenshots**. EasyOCR came in handy for that. It’s not perfect, but it’s light and works well for many use cases.

I wrote a simple wrapper that reads text from an image:

```ts
export async function ocrImage(path: string) {
  const worker = await createWorker("eng");
  await worker.loadLanguage("eng");
  await worker.initialize("eng");
  const { data: { text } } = await worker.recognize(path);
  await worker.terminate();
  return text;
}
```

It’s cool to see how a machine can now read text that used to be stuck in pixels.

## Step 3 – Scraping the Web with Playwright

When the data is already part of a web page, I use **Playwright** to grab it. I really like Playwright—feels like a browser you can control with code. You can click buttons, wait for things to load, and scrape exactly what you need.

Here’s how I pulled metadata from a page:

```ts
const entities = await page.$$eval("meta[property^='og:']", metas =>
  metas.map(m => ({
    name:  m.getAttribute("property")!,
    value: m.getAttribute("content")  || ""
  }))
);
```

Simple, readable, and very effective.

## Step 4 – Putting It All Together

Now the fun part: wiring it all up into an agent.

```ts
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model:       "gpt-4o-mini",
  messages:    [systemMsg, userMsg1, userMsg2],
  functions,   // the ones we defined earlier
  function_call: "auto",
  response_format: { type: "json_object" } // forces clean JSON
});
```

If OpenAI decides to call the `store_entities` function, I just read the arguments and act on them.

The feeling of watching the model **choose a function**, **fill it out properly**, and **pass valid data** is honestly super satisfying. It feels like I’m not just chatting with GPT—I'm collaborating with it.

---

## Final Thoughts

I didn’t expect it to work this smoothly. There were bugs, of course, but the general flow felt natural:

- OCR handles messy visual data
- Playwright grabs structured info
- OpenAI makes sense of it all and returns a clear action

Building this made me realize how **real AI agents are becoming**. It’s not just theory anymore—you can build useful mini tools with very little code.

If you’re thinking about diving into agents, this kind of setup is a great start.

## What’s Next?

- Add more functions like `send_email` or `create_task`
- Hook it up to a database (I’m thinking Prisma + Postgres)
- Maybe even a UI to see it all live?

Thanks for reading! Feel free to reach out if you’re building something similar—I’d love to connect.
